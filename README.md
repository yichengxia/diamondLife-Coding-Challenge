# diamondLife Coding Challenge

This is to build a Web page that helps users manage their *To Do List*.
You can try it online [here](https://raw.githack.com/yichengxia/diamondLife-Coding-Challenge/main/index.html).

This page has the following functionalities:

• Serves up an HTML, CSS and JS page to the browser

• Has an input box on the page that allows the user to enter a string

• When a string is entered, it is then added to the list

• Clicking on an item in the list marks it complete and moves it to the bottom of the list

• Clicking on the x of an item removes the item from the list

Additional functionalities include:

• Filter buttons that shows completed items only, shows to do items only, and shows all items

• Sort functionality that sorts the list by earliest to latest entry and in reverse
